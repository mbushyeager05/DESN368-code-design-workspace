				<p>Just as the town clock strikes two, the mayor steps up to the podium and begins to read. It’s the same story every year. He tells of the history of Panem, the country that rose up out of the ashes of a place that was once called North America. He lists the disasters, the droughts, the storms, the fires, the encroaching seas that swallowed up so much of the land, the brutal war for what little sustenance remained. The result was Panem, a shining Capitol ringed by thirteen districts, which brought peace and prosperity to its citizens. Then came the Dark Days, the uprising of the districts against the Capitol. Twelve were defeated, the thirteenth obliterated. The Treaty of Treason gave us the new laws to guarantee peace and, as our yearly reminder that the Dark Days must never be repeated, it gave us the Hunger Games.</p>

				<p>The rules of the Hunger Games are simple. In punishment for the uprising, each of the twelve districts must provide one girl and one boy, called tributes, to participate. The twenty-four tributes will be imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold anything from a burning desert to a frozen wasteland.</p>

				<p>Over a period of several weeks, the competitors must fight to the death. The last tribute standing wins. Taking the kids from our districts, forcing them to kill one another while we watch — this is the Capitol’s way of reminding us how totally we are at their mercy. How little chance we would stand of surviving another rebellion.</p>

				<p>Whatever words they use, the real message is clear. “Look how we take your children and sacrifice them and there’s nothing you can do. If you lift a finger, we will destroy every last one of you. Just as we did in District Thirteen.”</p>

			  <p>Why I chose this book: it's one of my favorite books. I think this book has messages everyone needs to know. I like the theme. There are many fonts that could fit this book; I wanted to find fonts that feel futuristic. I chose three different fonts because I wanted each part to have its own look. I wanted the "Chapter 1" part to be the most expressive with bold, expressive typography and increased line spacing so the body text doesn't feel crowded. I used a larger line-height to give breathing room. "Space Grotesk" keeps it easy to read while staying expressive. The other typefaces considered were "Audiowide" and "Space Mono"; they also fit the theme. I added letter spacing to avoid the text feeling squished; it helps readability and legibility. For the title and author I lowered the opacity to make it less prominent but still clear. I also used uppercase for the title/author to show importance.</p>
