## Reflection

**What was the hardest part of translating your design to code?**
The hardest part of translating my deisgn into code was the two column and figuring out how that worked. I had very little knowledge about it. Watched couple videos and even talk to "Claude" to help me undertand. I would say this was a challange but a fun challange.

**What CSS property/concept do you feel you understand better now?**
I think the CSS property/conecpty I feel I understand better now is parents and the flexbox. I think there is till quetsions and things I want to learn about flexbox.

**How closely does your code match your design? What would you do differently?**
I would say my code really does match my deisgn. The only thing I couln't get to work would be the main picture. There is no darker background or fading into the text. I had a hard time figure that out. I would love to explore more things like that to make my websites feel more like I want them to. I don't think there is anything I would do differntly maybe just some layout changes, but that us about it.
