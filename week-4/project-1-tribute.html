    <p class="summary">Tim Cook is the Chief Executive Officer of Apple Inc., one of the world's most valuable and influential technology companies. Since taking the helm in 2011 following Steve Jobs' death, Cook has led Apple through unprecedented growth, nearly tripling the company's market value and making it the first publicly-traded company to reach a $3 trillion valuation. Known for his meticulous operational expertise, unwavering commitment to privacy and environmental sustainability, and authentic leadership style, Cook transformed Apple from a company dependent on a single visionary into a resilient institution capable of sustained innovation. Beyond business, Cook became the first openly gay CEO of a Fortune 500 company, using his platform to advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, data privacy, and corporate social responsibility in an increasingly interconnected world.</p>

  <section class="education-full">
    <p class="education">Born November 1, 1960, in Mobile, Alabama, Tim Cook grew up in the small town of Robertsdale as the middle son of Donald Cook, a shipyard worker, and Geraldine Cook, a homemaker. Raised in a Methodist household with modest means, Cook's working-class upbringing instilled in him values of hard work, integrity, and service. He was intellectually gifted from an early age, excelling in mathematics and engineering, and graduated second in his class from Robertsdale High School in 1978.</p>

    <p class="education">Cook earned his B.S. in Industrial Engineering from Auburn University (1982), where he developed his passion for operations and systems thinking. He later earned an MBA from Duke University's Fuqua School of Business (1986-1988), graduating as a "Fuqua Scholar." This combination of engineering expertise and business acumen became his professional trademark, equipping him for the operational excellence he would bring to Apple decades later.</p>
