## Project description
    
This is a site that is Product Landing Page for LEGO. Included is difernt sectiosn featuring differnt LEGO Products. There is also a table and forms. The goal was to create a Product Landing Page that fit the theme and our style.

## Which CSS transform you implemented

There was several differt CSS Trasnforms that I included. The main one was hover on a card or a button.

## Which CSS animation you implemented

I implliments the Float and Rotate CSS Animation on the flowers in the "Discover Lego Botanical" section.

## Which table content type you chose

 Which table conetnt type Iused wsa to compare products. Like what the theme, age, number or pieces, price, and discription of the item. I wanted to create it for the holildays so shoppers could see some of the best Holiday Theme Lego Sets.

## Challenges encountered and solutions

There was so many challanges that I encountered throughout this whole project. The biggest one was the lego brick and creating them. It took me serveral days to fifure it out. I had Claude.Ai Sonnet 4.5 helmp with how I should I approch something like this since I have never mde an actual object in CSS. So it had me create several < div > items and gave them names for all them whihc included the brick part and the studs. Then used CSS to creat it using background-colro, stroke, Position: Relative and Position: Absolute. Plus chnaging the color while on hover and making them hover too. This was just one of the many challange and solutions that I occured throughout creating the LEGO Product Landing Page.

##Key learnings

The Key learning that I took away from cretaing the LEGO Product Landing Page was how difficult and tidous it can be to work with CSS hover and CSS Grid. I find them most useful for certain things such as in my design for opening and coling of the Card-Grid. This was one of the Key learning from working/desiigning the lEGO Product Landing Page. Another Key learning was that I need to be more organized whne building in CSS. I was jumping all over the place in bulidng my webiste in CSS that it strated to feel overhwelming becuase there was no organzised structure and I just didnt go design each section at once whihc was not the best ideas. Learned  my lesson from that. The reason why I did that is because I was getting frustated with that section because something wasn't working. So I would just avoid it which then caused other issues to happen in the LEGO Produc Landing Page. Again, will never do that again and leanred my lesson from that. This was another key learning th form working/design the LEGO Product Landing Page. The last key learning was I need to section out my CSS because after a while when you are working on a big site like that, your CSS strats to look alll the same. It's then super hard to find what you are looking for. I will defienlt be using that in the future, to help me stay/keep organized. I would like to go back through my LEGO Product Landing Page CSS and organzse the CSS. So I can find what I'm looking for in CSS and make it easier to change/adjust things. Also, work on media quiers at the same time instead of leaving them for last. I had AI help me iwth that becuase there was just so my CSS to look at. Again, leanred my lesss from that. This was one of the Key Learnings from working on the LEGO Product Landing Page. Overall, there was lots that I leanred from wokring/designing the LEGO Product Page and there was also lots of Key Learning for working/designing the LEGO PRoduct Landing Page.
